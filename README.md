# TensorFlow-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This a TensorFlow model for Recognition of Handwritten Digit. This model is commonly known as TensorFlow Hello World model.  We use MNIST dataset which is present in keras API. This dataset contain 60k images in training dataset and 10k in test dataset. Each image is of size 28*28. And each image have a label from the range {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
